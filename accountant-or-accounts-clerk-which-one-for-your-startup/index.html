  <p>The short answer is both! Why?</p>

<p>An <em>accountant</em><sup><a href="#accountant">1</a></sup> is needed to lay the correct and proper foundation whereas an accounts clerk is needed (assuming you have reasonable amount of transactions) to keep the books in orderly manner. Accounts clerk may also double as your payroll and admin clerk.</p>

<p>Note that, if you are on a strict budget, <strong>you can do many things yourself if your books are properly set up</strong>. You just need a review every 6 months or annually by your accountant. Sole proprietorship or partnerships accounts do not have audit requirements. Each person will have to file personal tax under Income Tax Act 1967 separately based on their share of profit from the business.</p>

<p>Proper set-up of books and early registration with the authorities (EPF, SOCSO, Customs, LHDN, etc.) with full set-up chart of accounts, accompanied by accounting manuals will save you a lot of headache and money later.</p>

<p>For example, you would want your depreciation policy to coincide with the tax authorities so that you don&rsquo;t have to keep two sets of accounts. There are also some tax planning (ensuring some expenses that would have otherwise be non-deductible be deducted for tax purposes) that you can do with proper guidance. If GST is applicable to your business, you will need a very tidy filing and claiming mechanism in place. There are GST special schemes that applies to specific industries, as well as annual adjustments and capital goods adjustments that you ought to know as the impact may be significant to your cash-flow.</p>

<p>You would also not want to be found infringing the law on employments. Do you know that by law, you need to pay EPF to your part-time worker? Even if you have an agreement that states that all monies will be paid to the staff directly instead of registering and paying EPF, the authorities can fault and still penalize you (if you have former employee who hold some grudge against you).</p>

<p>If you are planning to get grants or loans from <a href="http://www.mida.gov.my/home/list-of-miti-agencies/posts/">MITI agencies</a> like MIDA, MATRADE, SME Corp, MPC, MIDF, SME Bank or HDC; let your accountant handle that as well. There will be lots of application forms, supporting attachments and interview meetings to handle.</p>

<p>An accountant with experience in banking and financial industry (VC, private equity, etc.) would be able to add even more value to you. Typically well versed with accounting ratios and analysis, they would be very quick to review if your business and the accompanying figures make sense or not. They would be the one doing all the financial due diligence, oftentimes, readjusting your books to come up with a range of valuation that is reasonable for the deal team to make an offer for your business. Do not worry too, as they do have access to proper market comparatives from research analysts and benchmarking<sup><a href="#benchmarking">2</a></sup> from Bloomberg, APER, Cambridge Associates, BCG, Preqin, PEI, etc. KKR has been known to work with <a href="http://www.kkr.com/our-firm/kkr-capstone">KKR Capstone</a><sup><a href="#kkr">3</a></sup> to focus on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assessing operational improvement opportunities and risks during the due diligence process</li>
<li>Delivering meaningful and sustainable operational change within the portfolio companies</li>
<li>Leveraging the scale and scope of the KKR portfolio to develop cross-portfolio programs that can benefit all investments</li>
</ul>

<p><small>
<a name="accountant">1</a>: Notice how I use the word &ldquo;Accountant&rdquo; versus other generic terms like &ldquo;Finance Manager&rdquo; or &ldquo;Financial Consultant/Advisor&rdquo;? It is deliberate. Accountant is a protected word. Yes, only those who have passed some stringent exams and fulfilled specific years of working experience can carry that title. Ref: Accountants Act 1967 (Malaysia). So, when you hire some financial manager/consultant, check that they have someone qualified in the advisory team, best if they have done tax consultancy and company secretarial works before. When do you need an accountant? When you get your first customer ie start your business operations. Do note that you need a financial accountant, not management accountant. The former are experts in accounting standards and rules. We tend to call them as GAAP - Generally Accepted Accounting Policies. Hence, you always hear terms like US GAAP or UK GAAP. The latter are experts in costing and are well versed with various techniques to pin-point the cost of producing a unit of product or service. By the way, an accountant can also be a company secretary, under the Companies Act 1965 (Malaysia). If you are a not a company, don&rsquo;t bother about this yet. I will blog about company secretary later. A knowledgeable one will help you save a lot of money.</p>

<p><a name="benchmarking">2</a>: Will write about benchmarks when free. Selecting one over the other sometimes gives undue valuations. That is the art of the deal making business for investors.</p>

<p><a name="kkr">3</a>: In my humble opinion, KKR Capital and KKR Capstone are the same. They just separate out Capstone to charge additional fees to their Limited Partners. Limited Partnership Agreements allow them to use experts in completing deals; including “broken deal” expenses, costs for monitoring investments and legal fees. KKR has since refunded some fees paid after SEC stepped in.
