  <p>Crowdfunding is a generic term for sourcing from the public to fund a project or business using social media and the internet. There are many models for crowdfunding; donation-based, sponsor-ships, rewards-based, lending-based, equity-based. Equity crowd funding (ECF) is the most popular for start-ups in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>In July 2015, Malaysian Parliament passed the Capital Markets and Services Bill 2015 which paved the way for regularizing ECF. The Bill authorizes a raise of up to a maximum of RM3 million within a 12-month period regardless of the number of projects and an aggregate of RM5 million via the ECF Platform.</p>

<p>Six (6) operators have been pre-approved by the Malaysian Securities Commission (SC) to carry out the ECF platform, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alix Global</li>
<li>Ata Plus</li>
<li>Crowdonomic</li>
<li>Eureeca</li>
<li>PitchIN</li>
<li>Propellar Crowd</li>
</ul>

<p>Under Section 7 of the CMSA, an ECF Platform operator in Malaysia is required to register the electronic facility which facilitates the ECF. The operator is required to operate in an orderly, fair and transparent market, and have sufficient financial, human and other resources to operate the ECF Platform. The operator is required to make rules on the use of the ECF Platform, among other things, for the protection of investors, to ensure proper functioning of the market, to promote fairness and transparency, to ensure proper regulation and supervision of its members. The operator has an obligation to ensure that enterprises comply with the rules of the ECF Platform.</p>

<p>The ECF Platform operator is required, among other things, to conduct due diligence on prospective issuers on its platform, monitor the conduct of the issuer and take action against any misconduct of the issuer, conduct investor education programme, ensure the issuer’s disclosure document is verified and made accessible to investors through the platform.</p>

<p>Persons who are permitted to invest on the ECF Platform include retail, sophisticated and angel investors. Retail investors may only invest a maximum of RM5,000 per issuer with a total amount not exceeding RM50,000 in a year. An angel investor may invest RM5,000 per investment, up to a maximum of RM500,000 in a year. There is no limitation on the investment amount of a sophisticated investor. The ECF Platform operator, including its directors and shareholders, may invest on the platform not exceeding 30% of the controlling shares of the issuer.</p>

<p>Further Guidelines is available in <a href="http://www.sc.com.my/wp-content/uploads/eng/html/resources/guidelines/rep/guidelines_rep_150210.pdf">SC website for ECF</a>.</p>

<p>The key framework for founders are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>All locally incorporated companies with paid-up capital not exceeding RM5 million (other than exempt private companies) can issue ordinary and preference shares to the public;</li>
<li>Fund raise is between RM3 million to RM5 million;</li>
<li>File standardized disclosure with ECF operators;</li>
<li>Public listed companies and its subsidiaries are not allowed to participate via the ECF platform;</li>
<li>Funds raised cannot be used to provide loans or fund other investments in other entities;</li>
<li>Funds invested will be kept in a trust account by the ECF operator until specific conditions/ milestones are met.</li>
</ul>

<p>As one can see, the ECF platform sounds sweet as founders can get easy access to public funding, more opportunities to grow. The public, on the other hand, can have a tiny stake in your company from as little as RM5,000 and a good way to diversify their income.</p>

<p>However, there are also downside. You need to deliver per agreed milestones, and there is less room to re-negotiate your position as everything is more institutionalized under the platform. You really have to think carefully the milestones that you are willing or capable of delivering. Investor confidence is very important, once shaken, it is tough to restore. You will always be ready to deliver the perfect, compelling pitch and you need to keep engaging all stakeholders. Be ready to allocate more time for investor relations work besides running and growing your company.</p>

<p>To me, if your product or service is good, always opt for investors who can provide you the money, flexibility (think in-line with you) as well as the access to various doors (new strategic collaboration, segments, market growth, technical expertise, further sponsor-ships, etc). If you can find those qualities in one of the ECF operators, by all means&hellip; go for it. Do your due diligence on your investors too. Now, I cannot leak too much trade secrets here.. otherwise, you founders will use that against investors like me in negotiations. LOL.</p>
