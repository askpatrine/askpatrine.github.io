<p>There are dumb monies out there! No, seriously. I have seen VC funds putting money into ‘ideas’. They back friends. VC investors have the “peppering strategy”. They spread investment monies across all promising entrepreneurs with the hope that 1-2 will turn out to be a star that makes the 10-20x multiple.</p>

<p>The product (app/ website) was not even functional. Perhaps, it crashes easily. Some are heavily reliant on manual labour, which means that it was not designed to be scalable. Major rewriting of the code will cause painful setbacks. Do VCs check your product before they invest? Some do, most don’t. I have been in meetings where the rep from VC does not have a clue about the product nor the competitive landscape the potential investee is in. That rep is a CFO/Head of Investment rank btw.</p>

<p>Before I go on any further, for the sake of argument, for the need to be fair, there is really no complete due diligence that VCs can do. There are no track records. Maybe VCs can gauge the character of the founders from their previous stints. But then, people can change. Priorities change. Ideas pivot. it is all very subjective and could be positive or negative factor depending on how you want to argue.</p>

<p>Look at your growth, if you have steady growth of both new users and repeat users, you are ready to market your business for funding. Here’s what you need to do:</p>

<h2 id="1-canvas-the-fundraising-market-in-the-region-yes-not-just-country">1. Canvas the fundraising market in the region (yes, not just country)</h2>

<ul>
<li>You have to know which VCs are deploying money.</li>
<li>Forget those who are still raising money from their investors.<sup><a href="#forget">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Create your funnel from top to bottom. Narrowing it down based on whether your product and funding size is within their appetite and pointers below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-know-thy-investor">2. Know thy investor</h2>

<ul>
<li>This will be your bedfellow for the years to come. You need to know if they just treat you like one of the “peppered” baby or if they will really help you open doors, hold your hands in times of need and connect you to new collaborations.</li>
<li>If they have screwed other founders before, watch out.</li>
<li>Usually, the deal champion will be your go-to guy. Check the background of the deal champion (past achievements, motivation, capability, character)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-talk-to-other-founders">3. Talk to other founders</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don’t waste time. Just zero in to the VCs you would like to work with. Details of their portfolio company are easily found in their company website.</li>
<li>Founders will always help other founders. That’s my general observation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-talk-to-advisors">4. Talk to advisors</h2>

<ul>
<li>Accountants, lawyers, bankers etc. do know a lot of people and insider scoops.</li>
<li>Never pay introducer fees, the VCs have to pay for that. It’s like spare change for them.</li>
<li>Caveat, do not over rely on advisors. Lawyers only look at legal implications of things, you still need to decide on the commercial acceptability of the terms even at the Term Sheet level. Term Sheets are indicative of the final terms you will sign later.<sup><a href="#term">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-talk-to-the-vcs">5. Talk to the VCs</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ask them about the processes. Ask how long from initial contact to Investment Committee approval till the money is deployed. Track that progress.</li>
<li>Also ask about what will happen when key decisions have to be made on reserve matters. For example, if they need 3 people to say ‘aye’ and you know 1 will always be away for long trips, ask for a workaround. If they are rigid, it’s better for you to know it now.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to ask questions to gauge their empathy on ‘missing the milestones’ due to reasons beyond your controls.</li>
</ul>

<p><small>
<a name="forget">1</a>: VCs need to raise money from investors. Then only they will be able to invest money into your business. They are fund of funds. They charge their investors fees and performance carry. Usually they are bound by the 70% invested rule threshold before they can raise another fund. <strong>What it meas to you </strong>-1) They can only invest follow-on money to existing portfolio companies from current pool of fund. They c<strong>an&rsquo;t make new investment</strong> as the investment period is probably over by then. 2) <strong>It will be a while</strong> before new money come into the new fund. Practically, I would expect a minimum of 6 months process before the VCs could get their new funds sorted out.</p>

<p><a name="term">2</a>: You can ask me for high level advice and implications therefrom</strong> but you will have to decide if you are willing to accept the terms. Never wait until you are about to run out of cash to seek funding. You will be desperate and the VCs can see it.
