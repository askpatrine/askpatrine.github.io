  <p>I have been in the hiatus for a while. I blame it on my investment software procurement project, among other things.  I would like to make this post an interactive one. I welcome readers to ask any questions that you would ask your Accountant or Finance Manager or Company Secretary or Payroll Manager or Tax Advisor or Financial Strategist or Chief Financial Officer (for more advanced things like preparing for IPO, securing private debts, preparing Director&rsquo;s Statement for Annual Reports, business structures etc).</p>

<p>You would have probably noticed an overlap between an accountant with a lawyer&rsquo;s roles. Indeed, there are areas of overlap. Some law firms do provide tax and business structure advisory; company secretarial services, among others. However, experienced accountant provides better clarity for business issues as opposed to those that are strictly regulatory issues.</p>

<p>My objective here are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Address immediate, direct questions</li>
<li>Pinpoint areas for further dedicated posts</li>
<li>Prove to my husband that I am a good teacher, writer etc</li>
</ul>

<p>I am an Accountant by training. FCCA<sup><a href="#acca">1</a></sup> and MIA<sup><a href="#mia">2</a></sup>(Chartered Accountant). I have done tax compliance, international assignment services, payroll while in Deloitte Malaysia. Previously handled Group Accounts for several listed conglomerates and currently doing private equity investments. Therefore, I carry with me the practical and business view of things as I have been there, running the operations, managing the &lsquo;blood&rsquo; (aka cashflow) that feeds the business continuity and growth.</p>

<p><small>
<a name="acca">1</a>: Do ACCA member search for Thoong Lay Ting.</p>

<p><a name="mia">2</a>: MIA stands for Malaysian Institute of Accountants. It is the governing body of all registered accountants in Malaysia.
