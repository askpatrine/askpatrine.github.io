      <description>I have been in the hiatus for a while. I blame it on my investment software procurement project, among other things. I would like to make this post an interactive one. I welcome readers to ask any questions that you would ask your Accountant or Finance Manager or Company Secretary or Payroll Manager or Tax Advisor or Financial Strategist or Chief Financial Officer (for more advanced things like preparing for IPO, securing private debts, preparing Director&amp;rsquo;s Statement for Annual Reports, business structures etc).</description>

      <description>There are dumb monies out there! No, seriously. I have seen VC funds putting money into ‘ideas’. They back friends. VC investors have the “peppering strategy”. They spread investment monies across all promising entrepreneurs with the hope that 1-2 will turn out to be a star that makes the 10-20x multiple.
The product (app/ website) was not even functional. Perhaps, it crashes easily. Some are heavily reliant on manual labour, which means that it was not designed to be scalable.</description>

      <title>Crowdfunding in Malaysia</title>

      <description>Crowdfunding is a generic term for sourcing from the public to fund a project or business using social media and the internet. There are many models for crowdfunding; donation-based, sponsor-ships, rewards-based, lending-based, equity-based. Equity crowd funding (ECF) is the most popular for start-ups in Southeast Asia.
In July 2015, Malaysian Parliament passed the Capital Markets and Services Bill 2015 which paved the way for regularizing ECF. The Bill authorizes a raise of up to a maximum of RM3 million within a 12-month period regardless of the number of projects and an aggregate of RM5 million via the ECF Platform.</description>

      <title>Revenue projections for startup</title>

      <description>How long should you project? 1, 3 or 5 years? My husband always tells me that the Silicon Valley mentality is to project up to 18 months, anything beyond is crap because it is unreliable and irrelevant. Well, I beg to differ. The best practice for me is to project as far as you can! Also, it should jive with your long term strategic plan. You do not have to share your long term projections with any investors if they are not interested but it provides a good financial health roadmap.</description>

      <title>Accountant or accounts clerk, which one for your startup?</title>
      <link>http://askpatrine.com/2015/10/accountant-or-accounts-clerk-for-startup/</link>

      <description>The short answer is both! Why?
An accountant1 is needed to lay the correct and proper foundation whereas an accounts clerk is needed (assuming you have reasonable amount of transactions) to keep the books in orderly manner. Accounts clerk may also double as your payroll and admin clerk.
Note that, if you are on a strict budget, you can do many things yourself if your books are properly set up. You just need a review every 6 months or annually by your accountant.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a programmer, but my hubby told me it&amp;rsquo;s customary for &amp;ldquo;IT stuff&amp;rdquo; to start with &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have any topic to write at the moment, I welcome his suggestion :)</description>
