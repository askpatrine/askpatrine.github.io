      <description>How long should you project? 1, 3 or 5 years? My husband always tells me that the Silicon Valley mentality is to project up to 18 months, anything beyond is crap because it is unreliable and irrelevant. Well, I beg to differ. The best practice for me is to project as far as you can! Also, it should jive with your long term strategic plan. You do not have to share your long term projections with any investors if they are not interested but it provides a good financial health roadmap.</description>

      <title>Accountant or accounts clerk, which one for your startup?</title>

      <description>The short answer is both! Why?
An accountant1 is needed to lay the correct and proper foundation whereas an accounts clerk is needed (assuming you have reasonable amount of transactions) to keep the books in orderly manner. Accounts clerk may also double as your payroll and admin clerk.
Note that, if you are on a strict budget, you can do many things yourself if your books are properly set up. You just need a review every 6 months or annually by your accountant.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a programmer, but my hubby told me it&amp;rsquo;s customary for &amp;ldquo;IT stuff&amp;rdquo; to start with &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have any topic to write at the moment, I welcome his suggestion :)</description>
